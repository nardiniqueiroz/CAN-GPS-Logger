# CAN-GPS-Logger
This project intend to create a CAN logger and a DTC logger with the codes associated to the geographical coordinates where they happened.
It was tested in only one vehicle and its CAN buses were acessed directly.
You will be able to test it in your vehicle by changing the IDs on the filters and also the DTC request SID.
For further technical doubts about its development and testing feel free to contact me by the following e-mail: nardinicq@gmail.com.
